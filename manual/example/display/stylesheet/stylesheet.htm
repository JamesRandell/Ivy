<p>Stylesheets represent the templates that are usually found in either the 
site folder or i nthe shared theme directory.</p>

<p>When the template engine looks for a stylesheet to use it looks at in these 
places (first to last):
<ul>
	<li>extension/&lt;extension name&gt;/resource/template/</li>
	<li>site/&lt;site name&gt;/resource/template/</li>
	<li><span class="note small">(*)</span> shared/&lt;theme name&gt;/template/</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="note small">(*) The themes in the shared folder are only concerned with 
template resources, so miss out the 'resource' folder and go directly to the 
templates.
