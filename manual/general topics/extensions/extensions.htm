<p>An extension is an application that can be used by multiple sites. It will usually 
involve an installation process that sets up configuration setting and database 
entries.</p>

<h2>Why use extensions?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>minimise duplicated code</li>
	<li>use pre-built applications</li>
	<li>turn your site into an extension so you can use it in other sites</li>
</ul>

<p>Extensions also offer additional functionality to various parts of the framework 
itself (like the <strong>Workflow</strong> and <strong>User Management</strong> 
extensions).</p>
