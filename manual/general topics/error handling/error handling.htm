<p>Ivy comes with an error reporting module as part of it's core. Each site 
that is registered with the framework has every error stored in the 
database</p>

<h2>PHP coding errors</h2>
<p>The error module takes a leaf out of Zend Platform and mimics the categories 
of errors that errors get reported under. Any script error the falls in the 
standard PHP bitmask is recorded.</p>

<h2>Additional error types</h2>
<p>Errors that are reported get broken down in to further categories to better 
identify the generated report.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Slow Script Execution</li>
	<li>Slow Function Execution</li>
	<li>Slow Query Execution</li>
	<li>Database Error</li>
	<li>PHP Error</li>
	<li>PHP Notice</li>
	<li>Function Error</li>
	<li>Excess Memory Usage</li>
	<li>Load Average</li>
	<li>Ignore</li>
</ul>

<h2>Triggering errors</h2>
<p>To trigger an error in your application you should use the 
<strong>trigger_error</strong> function and pass the error string to it.</p>

<p>When this is invoked your error is recorded and can be viewed from the error 
module.</p>

<h2>Help</h2>
<p>When viewing the error report you also have links to the originating files, script 
location and line numbers and also related errors that are of the same type and 
source.</p>
