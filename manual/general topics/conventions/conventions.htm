<p>Common practices have been used to keep the code base well organised and 
structured.</p>

<h2>Naming - code</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Names are in camelCaps with the the first word in lowercase with every 
		first letter of each subsequent word capitalized.</li>
	<li><strong>Classes</strong> are usually seperated with an underscore.</li>
	<li><strong>Methods</strong> only contain A-Z names.</li>
	<li>Using the word <strong>Ivy</strong> should be avoided when naming things. 
		It should be treated as a reserved word and is used by the framework.</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>Naming - file structure</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Plural</strong> of a word are avoided - even if a folder contains 
		multiple files.</li>
	<li>The folder structure of core, extensions, themes and sites are very similar, 
		with the same names for folders being used throughout.</li>
	<li>Folder names are kept in <strong>lowercase</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Naming - database</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Plural</strong> of a word are avoided - even if a table contains 
		multiple files.</li>
	<li>All tables, keys, indexes, sequences and fields are in 
		<strong>UPPERCASE</strong>. </li>
</ul>
