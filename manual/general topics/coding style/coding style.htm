<p>The code-base is built using various standard writing styles to maintain 
commonality within the framework.</p>

<h2>Class/Method layout</h2>
<p>The "One True Brace Style" is used where ever possible</p>

<h2>Initialise variables</h2>
<p>The entire framework aims to be as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_type">strongly typed</a> as possible. 
As a result all variables are declared with their type at the start of a method.</p>

<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>Single quotes are used when there is text to be assigned to a variable.</p>
