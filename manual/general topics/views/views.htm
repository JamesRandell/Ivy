<p>The <strong>Views</strong> folder contains the templates that draw page 
elements on the screen.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Global templates</strong> that deals with the overall look 
		and feel of a site from one page to the next</li>
	<li><strong>Local templates</strong> are individual templates assigned to 
		one or more actions. They make the scaffolding for content that sits 
		inside the Global template</li>
	<li><strong>Global templates</strong> Cascading Style sheets</li>
	<li><strong>Widgets</strong> are individual pieces of code that have a 
		single purpose like displaying a result or a form</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Display</h2>
<p>All information passed to the display is accessable in a PHP array. To access 
the information held in this array, the variable <strong>$array</strong> can be 
used.</p>
 
<h2>Template engines</h2>
<p>Ivy has the capability of supporting multiple template engines (like Smarty 
or XSL). By default the framework uses it's own - <strong>Borne</strong>.<p>

<p>Borne syntax is recognised by the pair of curly braces (<strong>{}</strong>) 
that surround Borne commands.</p>

<p>It can also handle PHP tags like normal (<strong>&lt;?php ?&gt;</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>For a list of Borne commands refer to further documentation at the 
bottom of this page.</strong></p>

<h2>Why Borne?</h2>
<p>For really simple stuff it is better to learn Borne and use it's own syntax 
to display your information. For more complex statements you can simply switch 
to PHP code at will.</p>
