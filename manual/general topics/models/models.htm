<p>Ivy treats models as <strong>Data Dictionary</strong> files. They contain meta data 
about external data structures, validation, triggers and anything else that relates 
to a datasource. They are sometimes referred to in Ivy as <strong>Schemas</strong></p>

<h2>What makes up a Model</h2>
<p>A model contains information relating to data stored in a database of some 
kind. This could be SQL, XML, Excel - it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Each model will always contain the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>fieldSpec</strong> handles fields and validation</li>
	<li><strong>tableSpec</strong> selects a specific table</li>
	<li><strong>databaseSpec</strong> custom connection to databases or file 
		systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other uses</h2>
<p>Form validation rules are held in the <strong>fieldSpec</strong> part of a file. 
These contain rules challenge user input.</p>
